## Initial Access
- What is initial access?
- What is now the most common method for gaining initial access?
> Phishing!

## Initial Access
- What are some other techniques to gain initial access?

## Introduction to Exploit Research
- Transition from reconnaissance to weaponization
- Leverage intelligence/data about network
- Pair vulnerabilities to exploits
- Align exploits to operational objectives

## Research
- Open sources
- Organizational capabilities

## Capabilities
- Mission Objectives drive requirements
  - Collection
  - Effects
- Additional functionality to fulfill requirements
- Communications security (COMSEC)

## Testing
- Exploit Development occurs from vulnerability pairing and mission-drivens requirement
  - Test and verify success
- Testing provides a number of benefits:
  - Faster time to breakout of initial foothold
  - Reduced risk of detection and/or tool failure
  - Improved recovery times

## Plan
- Procure Hardware and software
- Assign developer
- Assign a tester to develop TTPs and break it
- Document testing results
- Testing environment
